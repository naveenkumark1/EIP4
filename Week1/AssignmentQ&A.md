# Write your own definitions for:

1) Convolution : Convoluiton is a process of combining two or more inputs from a input source and creating a single output.

2) Filters/Kernels : Filters/Kernels are the layers that are used to identify a particular pattern, edge or gradient in a given input image,
They can also be referred as channels.

3) Epochs : Epoch refers to a full cycle of informaiton flow in a neural network. 

4) 1x1 Convolution : Its a type of filter used to reduce the numbe of channels by combining the featuremaps

5) 3x3 Convolution : Its a type of convolution used to reduce the dimesnion and also the channels of the input.

6) Feature Maps : Featuremap is what we get when a kernal / filter moves over an image, It is a representation fo the captured featues in the image by the kernal / filter. 

7) Activation Function : A function that decides how much infomraiton should flow through the network

8) Receptive Field : The region on the input which a filter / kernal can see in a single go.
